## *data.table*

- R package by M Dowle, A Srinivasan, T Short, S Lianoglou, ...
- Current version: 1.9.6 (CRAN), 1.9.7 (devel)
- Description:

    Fast aggregation of large data (e.g. 100GB in RAM), fast ordered
    joins, fast add/modify/delete of columns by group using
    no copies at all, list columns and a fast file reader (fread). Offers a 
    natural and flexible syntax, for faster development.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("data.table")
```
```{r}
library(data.table)
```

## What is a *data.frame*?

A data.frame is like

- a  `matrix()` which can have different types of data in it (integer, character, factors, etc.)
- a `list()` of vectors which all have the same length. 


```{r}
data.frame(a = c(1,2,3,5), b = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
```

## And what's the thing about *data.table*?

- More efficient syntax:
    * (almost) everything can be done in square brackets `[]`
    * Fewer repititions of variable names
- Faster calculations:
    * Faster aggregation
    * Update by reference
- Less memory required (not quite true for small datasets)
- Fast reading of tabular data

And one of the most important things:

    Any R function from any R package can be used in queries not just the 
    subset of functions made available by a database backend


## *data.frame*, *data.table* and *SQL*

Selection     | *data.frame*  | *data.table*  | *SQL*
------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- 
Rows          | `DF[i, ]`     | `DT[i]`       | _WHERE_
Columns       | `DF[ , j]`    | `DT[, .(j)]`  | _SELECT_
Grouping      | _???_         | `DT[by = ...]`| _GROUP BY_


## *data.tables* general form

```{r, eval=FALSE}
DT[  i  ,          j     , by]
DT[where, select|update|do, by]
```

    Take rows i, calculate j and group by
    
Wait a minute, why *calculate j*? Don't we only want to select columns?


```{r, eval = TRUE, results='hide'}
data("mtcars")
mtcarsDT = data.table(mtcars)
mtcarsDT[mpg > 20,
         .(AvgHP = mean(hp),
           "MinWT(kg)" = min(wt*453.6)),
         by = .(cyl, under5gears = gear < 5)]
```

Implicit calculation of new variables, more to come...

## Example data: *mtcars*

Motor Trend Car Road Tests

```{r}
dim(mtcars)
ls.str(mtcars)
```


## Let's start with *i*
* Rows 1 - 3:
    * `mtcars[1:3, ]`
    * `mtcarsDT[1:3]`
* Only cars with 5 gears:
    * `mtcars[mtcars$gear == 5, ]`
    *  `mtcarsDT[gear == 5]`
* Only cars with 5 gears and more than 20 mpg:
    * `mtcars[mtcars$gear == 5 & mtcars$mpg > 20, ]`
    * `mtcarsDT[gear == 5 & mpg > 20]`

* Top 10% fuel efficient cars:
    * `mtcars[mtcars$mpg >= quantile(mtcars$mpg, 0.9), ]`
    * `mtcarsDT[mpg >= quantile(mpg, 0.9)]`


## *j*: select, update and calculate colums

If you want to select more than one column, you have to wrap you selection in `.()`.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcarsDT[, .(mpg, cyl)]
```

With this, you can directly calculate stuff:
```{r}
mtcarsDT[, .(mean_mpg = mean(mpg), 
             min_mpg = min(mpg),
             max_mpg = max(mpg))]
```

## *j*: select, update and calculate colums

_Warning_: Selection via column numbers does _not_ work anymore!
```{r}
mtcarsDT[, 1] # identicyl with mtcarsDT[, .(1)]
```

`data.frame`-like behavior can be forced with `with = FALSE`. (not recommended) 

```{r}
mtcarsDT[, 1, with = FALSE]
```


## *j*: select, update and calculate colums
_Nice to know_: You can use (almost) every function in *j*.

```{r}
mtcarsDT[, .(plot(mpg, hp))]
```

## Grouping with *by*
Again, use `.()` for multiple variables (or just us it always)
```{r}
mtcarsDT[, .(mean_mpg = mean(mpg)), by = .(cyl)]
```
We can use functions in  *by*:
```{r}
mtcarsDT[, .(mean_mpg = mean(mpg)),
             by = .(tons = round(wt * 0.4536))]
```


## Grouping with *by*
_Nice to know_: `.N` is a shortcut for `nrow()`

```{r}
mtcarsDT[, .(Nobs = .N), 
         by = .(cyl, am)]
```


## And now, everything together
For all cars with at least 20 miles per galon find the mean horse power and weight in kg, grouped 
by the number of cylinders and if they have less than five gears.
```{r}
mtcarsDT[mpg >= 20,
         .(AvgHP = mean(hp),
           "MinWT(kg)" = min(wt*453.6)),
         by = .(cyl, under5gears = gear < 5)]
```


## Fast search with *keys*

- *keys* are set as one (or more) columns in a dataset
- The dataset is always sorted (ascending) by *keys*
- *keys* do _not_ need to be unique
- (Don't think about these like primary keys in SQL)
```{r}
setkeyv(mtcarsDT, "cyl")
head(mtcarsDT)
```

## Fast search with *keys*

We can quickly filter for key values:

```{r}
mtcarsDT[.(6)]
```

## Fast search with *keys*

If multiple keys are set, they can be queried together:

```{r}
setkeyv(mtcarsDT, c("cyl", "carb"))
mtcarsDT[.(6, 4)]
```

## Define variables `:=`

Variables can directly be added, changed or deleted in the *j* part:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#new variable - weight in kg
mtcarsDT[, wt_kg := wt * 0.4536]

#changed variable - weight with only 2 digits
mtcarsDT[, wt_kg := round(wt_kg, 2)]

#delete variable - remove weight in kg
mtcarsDT[, wt_kg := NULL]
```


## Define variables `:=`

_Warning_: `:=` is modifying *by reference*, which means:
```{r}
mtcarsDT[, wt_kg := wt * 45.36]
```
Changes the dataset `mtcarsDT`!

A new assignment via `<-` or `=` is _not_ enough, you have to to use `copy()` if you actually want
to change a dataset.

## Define variables `:=`

```{r}
ncol(mtcarsDT)
mtcarsDT2 = mtcarsDT
mtcarsDT2[, wt_kg := NULL]
ncol(mtcarsDT)
```

*wt_kg* was removed in `mtcarsDT` as well!

## VDefine variables `:=`
```{r}
mtcarsDT[, wt_kg := wt * 45.36]
ncol(mtcarsDT)
mtcarsDT2 <- copy(mtcarsDT)
mtcarsDT2[, wt_kg := NULL]
ncol(mtcarsDT)
```

_But_: 

    A new referenced dataset does not need additional memory!



## Fast data import with `fread`

*data.table* offers with `fread()` a function to read in large (tabular) data extremly efficient. 

No benchmark but you can find a million SO:

## Transforming data with `reshape2`

`reshape2` is a package for efficient data transformation

Two of the most important function for us are `melt` and `dcast`

<br>
<br>
*wide* -> *long* : `melt`

*long* -> *wide* : `dcast`


##`reshape2`: `melt`

```{r}
wd <- data.frame(person = 1:3, 
                 weight = round(runif(3, min = 60, max = 90)),
                 size = round(runif(3, min = 160, max = 190)))
wd
                 
```
`wd` is in *wide* format!

##`reshape2`: `melt`

```{r}
wd_long <- melt(wd, id = "person")
wd_long
```

Die column *variable* can be set with `variable.name =`.

##`reshape2`: `dcast`

```{r}
wd_wide <- dcast(wd_long, person ~ variable)
wd_wide

all.equal(wd_wide, wd)
```


Both `melt` and `dcast` can work with multiple factors,

##`reshape2` for *data.table*

So why did we talk about `reshape2`?

`melt` and `dcast` are both implemented for *data.table*s!
 
_Warning_: `reshape` from *base* R always returns a *data.frame*!


## _JOIN_ing *data.tables*

JOIN          | *data.frame*               | *data.table*       | 
------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
INNER         | `merge(X, Y, all = FALSE)` | `X[Y, nomatch = 0]`|
LEFT OUTER    | `merge(X, Y, all.x = TRUE)`| `Y[X]`             |
RIGHT OUTER   | `merge(X, Y, all.y = TRUE)`| `X[Y]`             |
FULL OUTER    | `merge(X, Y, all = TRUE)`  |  -                 |

<br>
`merge()` Works for for *data.table* as well (required for a FULL OUTER JOIN)


## The _most important_ functionality


```{r}
data.table(x = rnorm(1000), y = rnorm(1000))

```

`print` function that doesn't break R for large datasets!


## Summary

- Filter rows in *i*
    - Set *key* for even faster filtering
- Do arbitrary calculations in *j* 
    - Always wrap in `.()`
    - Known *data.frame* syntax only works with `with = FALSE`
- Grouping with *by*
    - Again, wrap in `.()`
    - Functions can be used as well
- Define, update and delete variables with `:=`
    - Remember that all this is done *by reference*
- Use `melt` and `dcast` instead of `reshape`
- JOINS can be done with a minimal syntax
